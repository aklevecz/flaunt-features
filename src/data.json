The LA-based artist, Arima Ederra, poses the question we all know too well—the one we might to scared to ask or hear the answer to—with her new deeply-felt single “Portals.” The second offering from her long-awaited fall project is sewn with the tenderness of falling and the truthfulness of doubt when yearning for something that as already come and gone. Gently serene vocals carry her sincere confession that all rests on a blanket of sweet guitar strummings and lightly layered vocal riffs. Following her first single,“Free Again,\" Ederra expands on her intent to follow the tendrils of her psyche through reflection and revisiting the people, moments, and dreams that inevitably lead us to who we are. </p><p id=\"\">“'Portals' is a message about longing to be longed for. How humility guided me through a portal back to myself after heartache. It's about confronting why the absence of love seems to be the only time we realize we're out of time to say how we earnestly feel,” the artist shares. </p><p>‍</p>","_cid":"62feb8f1a4984e828b8c5fff","_id":"62febdf5da7ab1784141db52"},{"_archived":false,"_draft":false,"name":"MONCLER | LAUNCHES 2 MONCLER 1952 MEN’S COLLECTION","slug":"sample-1","updated-on":"2022-08-27T23:08:53.443Z","updated-by":"Person_603122a69ca862c05bb16546","created-on":"2022-08-18T22:31:55.577Z","created-by":"Person_62eb05ae8ab042f4d091a7d0","published-on":"2022-08-27T23:09:08.461Z","published-by":"Person_603122a69ca862c05bb16546","photo":{"fileId":"630a710e3591b595f970967e","url":"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/62ee0bbe0c783a903ecc0ddb/630a710e3591b595f970967e_flaunt2.jpeg","alt":null},"content-block-1":"<figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type- \" data-rt-type=\"\" data-rt-align=\"\"><div id=\"\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/62ee0bbe0c783a903ecc0ddb/630aa3c5c30273432e9c925b_2%2BMONCLER%2B1952%2BMAN_FW22_VOGUE%2BRUNWAY%2BIMAGES_1.jpeg\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">Today, <a href=\"https://www.moncler.com/en-us/\" id=\"\">Moncler</a> released their newest men’s collection, 2 Moncler 1952. Designed by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/sergiozambon/?hl=en\" id=\"\">Sergio Zambon</a>, the collection comes inspired by generations of subcultures throughout London. The brightness, volume, and movement of the collection capture the vivid sense of escapism Zambon was after. </p><p id=\"\">2 Moncler 1952 features essential items, including drawstring trousers and puffer jackets, and transforms them with brilliant hues, new silhouettes, and eye-catching prints. Moncler’s collaboration with heritage brand Barbour, whose iconic waxed cotton jacket appears now in the collection’s bright pop hues. Ocelot and tie-dye give movement to the collection’s color palette, including yellow, orange, and green as well as traces of chalk, black, and onion. </p><p id=\"\">Juxtaposing elements throughout the collection, such as matte and shiny surfaces or teddy fleece and technical nylon, Zambon brings the world a sense of unending possibility. </p><p id=\"\">Flaunt had a heart-to-heart with designer, Sergio Zambon, about Moncler’s latest collection. </p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type- \" data-rt-type=\"\" data-rt-align=\"\"><div id=\"\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/62ee0bbe0c783a903ecc0ddb/630aa3c6d9508385c23e8535_2%2BMONCLER%2B1952%2BMAN_FW22_VOGUE%2BRUNWAY%2BIMAGES_5.jpeg\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">When did you realize you were passionate about fashion and design? Was there a specific moment when you knew this was what you were fated to do?</strong> </p><p id=\"\">It’s a very obvious answer, and many others designers will have this answer too. I realized I had a passion for design when I was drawing outfits for my mother as a child. As I grew up, I was always interested in projects from architecture and fashion. Design was always my passion and it still is today. </p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">What significance does the number “1952” hold to this collection?</strong> </p><p id=\"\">It’s the year Moncler was founded. This inspires me in the sense of exploring the heritage of Moncler. It doesn’t inspire in a way of looking at the past, but the concept of evolving the heritage is what inspires me. We do have a heritage and heritage is richness. </p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Are there any people, places, or moments that inspired this collection the most?</strong> </p><p id=\"\">The 90s rave scene related to London. It was a moment, a vision of the rave party atmosphere. The overall space where this was happening. </p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">How has your creative process as a designer developed since you began at Moncler? Are there any rituals or routines you consider essential to your creative process?</strong> </p><p id=\"\">I started by recreating the heritage, the result was the first pop Genius collection. Now, it’s evolving in a more minimal approach, but still very bold. My design routine starts from the final vision. I can already see the collection when I close my eyes. I can see the location, the colors, the characters at the very beginning. And then I go through an extensive research process. </p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type- \" data-rt-type=\"\" data-rt-align=\"\"><div id=\"\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/62ee0bbe0c783a903ecc0ddb/630aa3c594ecc4df2935c27e_2%2BMONCLER%2B1952%2BMAN_FW22_VOGUE%2BRUNWAY%2BIMAGES_11.jpeg\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">You have a vast portfolio of past collections and collaborations. How have those experiences influenced your creative process today?</strong> </p><p id=\"\">My approach was always layered by different influences in a kind of positive anything goes approach. I have always believed that lots of influences together makes a very contemporary style: E pluribus unum. </p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Can you describe the person you are dressing? What are their hopes, dreams, etc.?</strong> </p><p id=\"\">They are a traveler, they travel countries, cultures, styles, and mix it all together. They go on a journey of the physical and the cultural. </p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">What direction do you see street style heading towards? Do you agree with it?</strong> </p><p id=\"\">I think street style is becoming one of the ingredients of the mainstream way of dressing nowadays, as we know. And the expression is multifaceted from luxury to generic. </p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">How do you continue to stay inspired? And who, what, and where do you visit to find inspiration?</strong> </p><p id=\"\">I was teaching at IUAV Venice once–they asked what is the main piece of advice you could give to a designer. I answered “be curious.” It’s curiosity that makes me inspired. Curiosity of discovering what is happening every day. I also love big cities, like Los Angeles.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type- \" data-rt-type=\"\" data-rt-align=\"\"><div id=\"\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/62ee0bbe0c783a903ecc0ddb/630aa3c6cd0330667c8d9df4_2%2BMONCLER%2B1952%2BMAN_FW22_VOGUE%2BRUNWAY%2BIMAGES_16.jpeg\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">To shop the 2 Moncler 1952 Men’s Collection, visit the Moncler <a href=\"https://www.moncler.com/en-us/genius/shop-moncler-genius/2-moncler-1952-man\" id=\"\">website</a>. </p><p>‍</p>","author":"62f03a749147fea002655563","_cid":"62feb8f1a4984e828b8c5fff","_id":"62febddb8127734c7dee79d5"},{"_archived":false,"_draft":false,"name":"ARMORY OFF-SITE AT THE US OPEN | THE ARMORY SHOW AND THE UNITED STATES TENNIS ASSOCIATION","slug":"distinctio-ut-ipsam","updated-on":"2022-08-27T23:08:47.621Z","updated-by":"Person_603122a69ca862c05bb16546","created-on":"2022-08-18T22:11:05.688Z","created-by":"Person_62eb05ae8ab042f4d091a7d0","published-on":"2022-08-27T23:09:08.461Z","published-by":"Person_603122a69ca862c05bb16546","photo":{"fileId":"630a711960046f6fe209ba70","url":"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/62ee0bbe0c783a903ecc0ddb/630a711960046f6fe209ba70_flaunt3.jpeg","alt":null},"author":"62f03a749147fea002655563","content-block-1":"<figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type- \" data-rt-type=\"\" data-rt-align=\"\"><div id=\"\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/62ee0bbe0c783a903ecc0ddb/630aa3f5c93c97365ba8abc7_FLAUNTUSTA1330672_20220822_PlayerPractice__CJ12843.jpeg\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div><figcaption id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Gerald Chukwuma</strong>, OGADILIGMMA, 2021.
